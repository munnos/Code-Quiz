# Code-Quiz

## About

In this project I have created a code quiz to enhance my ability to use javascript to make a dynamic application.

After pressing the "Start Quiz" button the user then starts the quiz in earnest.
When the user presses the button, the timer is started and the questions start. 
These are all dynamically rendered through use of javascript. The questions are stored in arrays and then rendered as the user progresses through the quiz through 
utilisation of a 'for' loop.

The score data is then stored in local storage to enable a log of highscores to be kept as you can see below. 
The main aspect of this project was to ensure the functionality worked
but to make the project aesthetically pleasing I also made use of bootstrap to give the project a cleaner, more polished interface.
